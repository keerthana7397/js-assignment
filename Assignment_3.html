Datatypes in JavaScript:

There are basically 8 data types in JavaScript.
Number, BigInt, String, boolean, null, undefined, objects, symbol.

Number:
Number type variables can store both integers and floating point values. All mathematical operations are possible in this type. Special numeric values such as infinity and NaN (Not a number) are also considered to be numeric data type.

BigInt:
Number data type variables cannot store integer values greater than 2^(53) -1 or lesser than -2^(53)-1.
BigInt value is used for such big values as the name suggests. A BigInt number is represented by appending 'n' at the end of an integer. BigInt is supported in chrome, firefox and edge but not in safari or Internet Explorer.

Example: 
const bigInt= 1234567890012345678912345678901234567890n;

String:
Double and single quotes are “simple” quotes. There’s practically no difference between them in JavaScript. There are no char type variables in JavaScript.

Backticks (` `) are “extended functionality” quotes. They allow us to embed variables and expressions into a string by wrapping them in ${…}.

Example:
let name = "John"; // embed a variable 
alert( `Hello, ${name}!` ); // Hello, John! 

// embed an expression 
alert( `the result is ${15 + 7}` ); // the result is 22

Boolean:
The boolean type has only two values: true and false. They are used in logical statements.

Example:
let nameFieldChecked = true; // yes, name field is checked let ageFieldChecked = false; // no, age field is not checked

Null:
In JavaScript, null is not a “reference to a non-existing object” or a “null pointer” like in some other languages.
It’s just a special value which represents “nothing”, “empty” or “value unknown”.

Example:
let age = null;

Undefined:
The meaning of undefined is “value is not assigned”.
If a variable is declared, but not assigned, then its value is undefined.
It is also possible to assign undefined to a variable explicitly.

Example:
var age= undefined;

Objects:
All other types are called “primitive” because their values can contain only a single thing (be it a string or a number or whatever). In contrast, objects are used to store collections of data and more complex entities. Objects are used for complex data structures.

Symbols:
The symbol type is used to create unique identifiers for objects.
