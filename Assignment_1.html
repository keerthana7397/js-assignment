Console in Javascript:
In javascript, the console is an object which provides access to the browser debugging console. Hence it is mainly used by testers for debugging process.
Console can be opened in web browser like chrome by using commands like Ctrl + Shift + K for windows.
Different types of console are.
log()
error()
warn()
clear()
time() and timeEnd()
table()
count()
group() and groupEnd()
custom console logs

console.log()
Mainly used to print the output to the console. We can use any datatype inside the log(), be it a string, array, object, boolean etc.
Example: console.log('Welcome to the console');
console.log(57);

console.error()
It is used to log error messages and is used for testing purposes. By default when an error occurs it is highlighted in red colour.
Example: console.error('Oops! An error occured');

console.warn()
If any warning is to be given then it is by default highlighted in yellow colour. This warning is given by using console.warn();
Example: console.warn('Warning! Memory exceeded!');

console.clear()
It is used to clear the console of any previous operations that are displayed. It will display a blank console.
Example: console.clear();

console.time() and console.timeEnd()
It is used to calculate the amount of time spent by a block of code or function. They take a label which must be same, and the code inside can be anything.
If the amount of code between the console.time() ans console.timeEnd() is increased the time is also increased. The time is calculated in terms of milliseconds.
Example:
console.time('abc'); 
 function fun =  function(){ 
     console.log('fun is running'); 
 } 
 function fun2 = function(){ 
     console.log('fun2 is running..'); 
 } 
 fun(); // calling fun(); 
 fun2(); // calling fun2(); 
console.timeEnd('abc'); 


console.table()
It is used to generate a table inside the console. The input to this console must be in the form of an array or an object that is to be converted into a table.
Example:
console.table({'a':41, 'b':12, 'c':32});
The first coloumn takes the first value and second column takes the second value.

console.count()
It is used to count the number of times the function is called or the number of times something is executed. It is useful in a for loop.
Example:
for(var i=0;i<5;i++){ 
    console.count(i); 
}

console.group() and console.groupEnd()
group() and groupEnd() methods of the console object allows us to group contents in a separate block, which will be indented. 
Just like the time() and the timeEnd() they also accepts label, again of same value.
Example:
console.group('simple'); 
console.warn('warning!'); 
console.error('error here'); 
console.log('vivi vini vici'); 
console.groupEnd('simple'); 

Custom Console logs
User can add Styling to the console logs in order to make logs Custom.
The Syntax for it is to add the css styling as a parameter to the logs which will replace %c in the logs.
Example:
const spacing = '10px'; 
const styles =  `padding: ${spacing}; background-color: white; color: green; font-style:italic; border: 1px solid black; font-size: 2em;`; 
console.log('%cLearning about Consoles', styles);
